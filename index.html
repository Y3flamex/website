            <h2>## hi</h2>
                <p>hi, im bow. Im a cybersecurity major trying to break into the field. i was born in puerto rico, and plan to retire there one day. i love tackling on new projects, like this website. i like to build things in real life, you can find a list of the things i've built in my portfolio, but here are a couple if youre lazy</p>
            <ul>
                <li>my computer</li>
                <li>willy firmware (like a flipper zero but open source)</li>
                <li>bookshelf speakers</li>
                <li>a custom arcade controller</li>
                <li>a custom arcade cabinet</li>
                <li>several keyboards</li>
                <li>a racing sim</li>
                <li>slimevr full body trackers</li>
            </section>
        <section>
            <p>i also like to mod things, i mod old consoles all the time, i like modding audio gear, and i like modding stupid stuff like a translator pen. i also am a huge advocate for right to repair, and i tend to repair all my own stuff, and for friends and family. the right to repair, in my opinion, is the right to own your property, and i am a huge advocate for that. im planning on opening up my own music studio soon, as music has always been a passion for me. my main DAW is fl studio, i run it on linux on my laptop and on windows in my desktop. i run a riced out version of pop!os on my laptop for school, but have used arch in the past (before archinstall was a thing so i have my stripes)

            <h2>## what am i working on?</h2>
            <p>right now im working on my studio, trying to finish up the electrical wiring for it. on the side im trying to learn how to use pro tools as the only daw i have experience with at all is fl studio. this website is also something im working on right now, as ive put off making one for a long time. i plan on making it look nicer than now, as it's quite bare-bones.</p>
